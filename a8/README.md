**B. Description**
My final project is to build a web portfolio that can introduce myself to others, exhibit my past experiences, and showcase my works. 
Some key information that is included in my website include: my resume, my works, summary of my experience and background, and contact information.
There is no specific target audience. Anyone is welcome to view my website. Further revisions will be made since I am planning to use it as
a portfolio piece to include in future career-related applications.

It is built to be engaging through the use of animations and interactivity (click, hover, etc)!
