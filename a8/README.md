**B. Description**
My final project is to build a web portfolio that can introduce myself to others, exhibit my past experiences, and showcase my works. 
Some key information that is included in my website include: my resume, my works, summary of my experience and background, and contact information.
There is no specific target audience. Anyone is welcome to view my website. Further revisions will be made since I am planning to use it as
a portfolio piece to include in future career-related applications.

It is built to be engaging through the use of animations and interactivity (click, hover, etc)!

**E. Iteration from HW7**
Changes such as the position of the shapes and texts, and the color scheme are applied to my final coded web portfolio. I also took out the list of courses and chose to focus on my works. Also, instead of including a separate contact page, I chose to only kept the "Get in Touch" section and socials icons. Based on the feedback received, I added more content/sections in my about page as well.

F. Major Challenges
The major challenges I encountered are implementing the hovering effects (show text on image when hover) and learning bootstrap. Since it was my first time using Bootstrap in building a website, it took me a while learning how the commands are used and what they mean. Adding the hovering over effects was also a challenge since I was having issues with merging the code with Bootstrap as well as animations.
