B. Description: My final project is to build a web portfolio that can introduce myself to others, exhibit my past experiences, and showcase my works. Some key information in my website includes: my resume, works, summary of my experience and background, and contact information. There is no specific target audience. Anyone is welcome to visit my website! Further improvements will be made since I am planning to use it as a portfolio piece to include in future career-related applications. It is built to be engaging through the use of animations and interactivity (click, hover, etc)!

D. External Libraries

Bootstrap 5 (1) Name: Bootstrap 5 (2) Why I chose it: I chose it since it has existing frameworks provided to use and can easily make the website responsive. (3) How I used it: It's included in the main, section, and div tags. (4) It creates responsiveness for the website, navigation bar, and carousel for the website.

JavaScript Library (1) Name: jQuery (2) Why I Chose it: I chose to use it since it supports the Bootstrap buttons, navigations, and other components. (3) How I used it: It's included in the js folders and it supports the Bootstrap functions internally. (4) It adds navigation and button directing functionalities to the website.

Animation (1) Name: Animation in transition, mouse hovering, and viewing (2) Why I Chose it: I chose to use it to increase interactivity of my portfolio, making it more engaging and interesting to explore. (3) How I used it: I used it within css with @keyframes, -webkit-transition, transition, etc. (4) It adds animation and other special effects to my web pages and the transition between them.

Others (1) Google Fonts API included in CSS and HTML

E. Iteration from HW7: Changes such as the position of the shapes and texts, and the color scheme are applied to my final coded web portfolio. I also took out the list of courses and chose to focus on my works. Also, instead of including a separate contact page, I chose to only kept the "Get in Touch" section and socials icons. Based on the feedback received, I added more content/sections in my about page as well.

F. Major Challenges: The major challenges I encountered were implementing the hovering effects (show text on image when hover) and learning bootstrap. Since it was my first time using Bootstrap in building a website, it took me a while learning how the commands are used and what they mean. Adding the hovering over effects was also a challenge since I was having issues with merging the code with Bootstrap as well as animations.
